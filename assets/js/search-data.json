Forecasting: Principles and Practice - Chapter 10 Forecasting hierarchical or grouped time series . Blog Posts . Bayesian Methods for Multilevel Modelling . A Primer on Bayesian Methods for Multilevel Modeling . Hierarchical Linear Regression in PyMC3 . The best of both worlds: Hierarchical Linear Regression in PyMC3 . Introduction . Hierarchical modeling is especially advantageous when in the presence of multi-level data, making the most of all available information by it’s “shrinkage-effect”. Software like HDDM allows hierarchical Bayesian estimation of a widely used decision making model, but here we will use a classical example of hierarchical linear regression to predict radon levels in houses. . Gelman et al.’s (2007) radon dataset is the canonical example for Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling. In the dataset the amount of radiation has been measured amongst different households in all counties of several US States. Radon gas is known as the highest cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. It is believed to enter the house through the basement. Additionally its concentration differs regionally due to differences in soil type. . The exercise is to attempt to predict radon levels in different counties and where in the house it was measured. . Data Source: radon.csv Columns: county, log_radon, floor where floor = 0 is the basement, floor = 1 is the 1st floor, and so forth. . Single regression (pooled model) . A common way of solving this would be to pool all the data and estimate one regression to assess the influence of measurement across counties. The model would follow the following specification: . radoni,c=α+β∗floori,c+ϵradon_{i,c} = alpha + beta * floor_{i,c} + epsilonradoni,c​=α+β∗floori,c​+ϵ . where $i$ corresponds to the measurement, $c$ corresponds to the county and floor corresponds to which floor the measurement was made. We then estimate a single intercept and a single slope for all measurements over all counties. We are assuming that all the counties are exactly the same. . Separate regressions (unpooled model) . Imagine however we were interested, for instance, in seeing the differences in relationship (slope) or base-rates of radon (intercept) across counties. We could generate $n$ regressions, where $n$ is the number of counties. Such model would follow the following specification: . radoni,c=αc+βc∗floori,c+ϵcradon_{i,c} = alpha_c + beta_c * floor_{i,c} + epsilon_cradoni,c​=αc​+βc​∗floori,c​+ϵc​ . Now, for every county $c$, we are estimating $ alpha_c$ and $ beta_c$, up to $n$ total counties. In this version, the upooled version, we assume the extreme opposite of the former model. Instead of assuming all counties are exactly the same, we are assuming they share no similarities between them. . Hierarchical Regression . There is a middle ground between a fully pooled model and an unpooled model. It’s a Hierarchical Model. Specifically, while we may assume that while $ alpha$s and $ beta$s are different for each county, they all come from a common group distribution: . αc∼N(μα,σα2)βc∼N(μβ,σβ2) alpha_c sim mathcal{N}( mu_ alpha, sigma^2_ alpha) beta_c sim mathcal{N}( mu_ beta, sigma^2_ beta)αc​∼N(μα​,σα2​)βc​∼N(μβ​,σβ2​) . Here the assumption is that the intercepts $ alpha$ and slopes $ beta$ all come from a normal distribution centered around their respective group mean $ mu$ with a certain standard deviation $ sigma^2$, values (posteriors) which we also estimate. It is for this reason that such a model is named Multilevel or Hierarchical. . Using Probabilistic Programming, with a framework like pyMC3, . Advanced Hierarchical Linear Regression in PyMC3 .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
